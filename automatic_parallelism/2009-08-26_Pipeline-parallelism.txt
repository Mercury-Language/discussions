Pipeline parallelism
====================

If one computation produces values for another computation to consume
and those values can be stored within a list or similar structure the
list can be turned into a sequence (lazy list) to allow for
producer/consumer or pipeline parallelism.

The same can probably be done with some of the things in the mercury
standard library under thread.sequence and such.

The danger with any of these things is that if the producer creates
values faster than they can be consumed this can lead to the queue
growing quite large in size and causing other performance issues.
