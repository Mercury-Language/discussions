Given a parallel conjunction

	p(..., X, ...) & q(..., X, ...)

in which the shared variable X represents a data structure such as a list,
we don't want to wait until X is ground to transmit its value from p to q.

We can reserve a primary tag value to represent "this is not here yet".
We could make this ptag value be the same for all types, e.g. 7 on 64 bit
platforms.

For a list, the valid ptags would be

	0	nil; rest of word is zero
	1	cons; rest of word points to cons cell with head and tail,
		with the tail having the same three possibilities
	7	future; rest of word is a pointer to the future

Code that gets an incrementally generated value of this type as input
would check the tag on first access to the value. If it is 7, it would wait
on the future as usual for parallel code. When it wakes up, it would be able
to get the value (which can have only 0 or 1 as tags) from the future.

Code that generates a value incrementally should, when it binds one function
symbol of the incrementally-generated type,

	1 create a heap cell if needed by the arguments of the function symbol,
	2 fill in the fields of the cell, with the recursively-typed fields
		being filled in with 7-tagged pointers to futures,
	3 it should replace the original 7-tagged pointer to the future
		with an appropriately tagged pointer to the cell
		or with an appropriately tagged constant (for constants)
	4 it should then signal the future

To make step 3 possible, the calling convention would need to dictate that
when passing incrementally generated values, what should be passed is not
the 0-, 1- or 7-tagged word, but a pointer to it. The pointer may point to a
word in a cell on the heap (for every list element except the first), or
to a word in a stack frame (for the first list element).

    Step three is not necessary, it's simply an optimization.  Anything
    reading the data structure will read a future, wait on it, which will
    return immediatly and update the cell that pointed it to the future.  This
    is slower, so if step 3 is easy we should do it - pbone.

I've (pbone) noticed another problem. code that generates these structues has
to be re-ordered some what so that it takes a similar form to the
tail-call-module-constructor code, for example consider map/3 that produces a
lazy list as it's output.  This eaxmple follows the dscription Zoltan wrote
above, including step 3.

    new_future(Future),
    L = make_future_tag(Future),
    (
        map(P, L0, &L),
    ;
        ...
    ),
  
    map(P, L, FuturePtr) :-
        Future = *FuturePtr
        (
            L = [],
            % Note that the new value is provided both by setting the pointer
            % and by signaling the future.
            *FuturePtr = [],
            signal(FuturePtr, [])
        ;
            L = [X | Xs],
            P(X, Y),
            new_future(Future2),
            FuturePtr2 = make_future_tag(Future2),
            ConsCell = cons(Y, FuturePtr2),
            MEMORY_WRITE_BARRIER,
            *FuturePtr = ConsCell,
            signal(Future, ConsCell),
            map(P, Xs, FuturePtr2)
        ).

    Note how the cons cell is constructed before the recursive call.
