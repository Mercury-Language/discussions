In Multi-Socket and Multi-Die systems communication costs are
non-uniform, either because of bus bandwidth/latency or the memory
hierarchy.  This is also applicable to mutli-core hyper-threading
systems, which will be commodity systems shortly.

On these systems I believe it would be preferable for an engine to
steal aparks from engines on nearby cores.
